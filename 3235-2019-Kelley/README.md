# An Introduction to the ODS Destination for Word                                                                                                       

The SAS® Output Delivery System (ODS) destination for Word enables customers to deliver SAS® reports as native Microsoft Word documents. The ODS WORD statement generates reports in the Office Open XML Document (.docx) format, which has been standard in Microsoft Word since 2007. The .docx format uses ZIP compression, which makes for a smaller storage footprint and speedier downloading. ODS WORD is preproduction in the sixth maintenance release of SAS 9.4. 

This paper shows you how to make a SAS report with ODS WORD. You learn how to create your report's content (images, tables, and text). You also learn how to customize aspects of your report's presentation (theme and styles). And you learn how to enhance your report with reader-friendly features such as a table of contents and custom page numbering. If you're cutting and pasting your SAS output into Microsoft Word documents, then this paper is especially for you!
